## What is Recon-ng?

Recon-ng is an open-source reconnaissance framework designed to simplify the process of gathering information about a target. Built with a modular architecture, Recon-ng allows users to perform OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tasks efficiently by combining various data sources into a single interface. The tool is written in Python and comes with a command-line interface that mimics the Metasploit framework, making it both familiar and user-friendly for penetration testers.

At its core, Recon-ng provides:
- Modules for collecting emails, subdomains, and IP addresses.  
- Integration with APIs for automated data gathering.  
- Comprehensive reporting capabilities for analysis and documentation.  

By automating time-consuming reconnaissance tasks, Recon-ng allows penetration testers to focus on analyzing results and identifying actionable insights.

## Why Use Recon-ng?

Recon-ng offers several advantages that make it a go-to tool for penetration testers and cybersecurity professionals:

1. **Automation of Reconnaissance Tasks**  
   Recon-ng eliminates the need to manually query multiple sources for data, saving time and effort during the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Modular Architecture**  
   With its wide array of modules, Recon-ng can be tailored to specific reconnaissance needs, from discovering subdomains to identifying vulnerabilities in DNS records.

3. **API Integration**  
   Recon-ng supports integration with APIs like Shodan, Whois, and VirusTotal, enabling it to gather data from various sources seamlessly.

4. **Data Normalization**  
   Recon-ng standardizes the data it collects, making it easier to analyze and use in subsequent phases of penetration testing.

5. **Comprehensive Reporting**  
   The tool generates detailed reports that can be shared with stakeholders, ensuring transparency and actionable insights.

## Common Recon-ng Use Cases

### 1. **Subdomain Discovery**
Finding subdomains of a target domain can reveal overlooked assets or services. Recon-ng automates this task using DNS records and search engine queries.

**Command Example:**  
```bash
modules load recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts
set source example.com
run
```

### 2. **Email Address Harvesting**
Recon-ng can extract email addresses associated with a target domain by querying public data sources.

**Command Example:**  
```bash
modules load recon/contacts-contacts/mailtester
set source example.com
run
```

### 3. **IP Address Geolocation**
Using API integrations, Recon-ng can provide geolocation data for discovered IP addresses.

**Command Example:**  
```bash
modules load recon/hosts-hosts/ipinfo
set source 192.168.1.1
run
```

### 4. **Whois Information Retrieval**
Recon-ng can query Whois databases to gather registration details for domains and IP addresses.

**Command Example:**  
```bash
modules load recon/domains-hosts/whois_pocs
set source example.com
run
```

### 5. **Vulnerability Assessment**
With its extensible module library, Recon-ng can also identify vulnerabilities in target systems by analyzing public data.

## Ethical Considerations

As with any reconnaissance tool, ethical considerations are paramount when using Recon-ng. Unauthorized data collection can violate privacy laws and ethical guidelines. Always ensure that you have explicit permission from the target organization before conducting any reconnaissance activities. Following industry standards like the **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)** or **OWASP Testing Guide** is essential to ensure compliance and professionalism.
