## What is Netstat?

Netstat is a command-line tool available on most operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. It displays network connections, interface statistics, and routing information, offering a snapshot of network activity.

Key capabilities of Netstat include:
- Listing active TCP and UDP connections.  
- Displaying listening ports and their associated processes.  
- Providing statistics for network interfaces.  

Netstat is invaluable for diagnosing connectivity issues and monitoring network activity.

## Why Use Netstat in Cybersecurity?

Netstat is essential for understanding network behavior and detecting anomalies. Here’s why it’s a crucial tool for cybersecurity:

1. **Identifying Suspicious Connections**  
   Detect unauthorized or unusual connections that could indicate malware or intrusions.

2. **Monitoring Open Ports**  
   Verify which services are running and listening on specific ports.

3. **Analyzing Network Performance**  
   Gather statistics on packet transmission and errors for troubleshooting.

4. **Forensic Investigations**  
   Trace connections and analyze traffic patterns during incident response.

5. **Verifying Firewall Rules**  
   Ensure that ports and services are properly restricted.
