## Key Features of Intruder

### 1. **Attack Types**
Select from four customizable attack types:
- **Sniper:** Targets one parameter at a time.
- **Battering Ram:** Reuses the same payload across multiple positions.
- **Pitchfork:** Uses different payloads in parallel.
- **Cluster Bomb:** Tests all combinations of payloads.

### 2. **Payload Options**
Configure payload sets with custom wordlists, predefined patterns, or manually entered data.

**Example Command:**
```bash
wordlist.txt -> usernames or fuzzing values
```

### 3. **Real-Time Feedback**
Monitor server responses to identify anomalies or error messages.

### 4. **Customized Attack Parameters**
Define specific injection points and payload positions within HTTP requests.

### 5. **Detailed Analysis**
Sort and filter responses by status codes, response times, or content length.

## Setting Up Burp Suite’s Intruder

### 1. **Capture a Request**
Intercept and capture an HTTP request using Burp Suite’s Proxy module.

### 2. **Send to Intruder**
Right-click on the captured request and select **“Send to Intruder”** from the context menu.

### 3. **Configure Positions**
Highlight the parameters to be tested and define injection points.

### 4. **Select Attack Type**
Choose an attack type based on your testing objective (e.g., Sniper or Cluster Bomb).

### 5. **Set Payloads**
Upload or define payloads for the attack.

**Command Example:**
```bash
file: /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

### 6. **Start the Attack**
Click **“Start Attack”** to initiate the test and monitor responses in real-time.

## Common Use Cases for Intruder

### 1. **Testing Login Forms**
Brute-force credentials using a dictionary attack.

**Command Example:**
```bash
username:admin password:wordlist.txt
```

### 2. **Parameter Fuzzing**
Inject payloads into query strings, headers, or body parameters.

### 3. **Testing for Injection Flaws**
Identify vulnerabilities like SQL injection or command injection.

### 4. **API Enumeration**
Fuzz API endpoints to discover undocumented functionality or data leaks.

### 5. **Custom Workflow Testing**
Simulate complex attacks by combining payloads and attack types.
