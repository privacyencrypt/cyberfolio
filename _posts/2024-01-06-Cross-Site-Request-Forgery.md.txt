**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is a web security vulnerability that tricks users into executing unwanted actions on a trusted website. By exploiting the trust between a browser and a server, attackers can perform actions as the victim, such as transferring funds or changing account details. This blog post explores the mechanics of CSRF, its impact, and practical measures for detection and prevention. Follow the included **lab walkthrough** for hands-on practice.

## What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?

CSRF is a web application attack where malicious requests are made from the authenticated user's browser without their knowledge. It leverages the fact that browsers automatically include session cookies and authentication tokens in requests to trusted websites.

Key characteristics of CSRF attacks:
- Exploits authenticated user sessions.  
- Does not require the attacker to compromise the victim’s credentials.  
- Relies on social engineering to trick users into executing malicious actions.

## Why is CSRF Dangerous?

CSRF attacks can have severe consequences for users and organizations. Here’s why it’s a critical issue:

1. **Unauthorized Transactions**  
   Attackers can perform financial transactions, change user settings, or transfer sensitive information.

2. **Privilege Escalation**  
   Exploiting admin accounts can allow attackers to take over an entire application.

3. **Data Integrity Compromise**  
   Unauthorized actions can modify, delete, or corrupt critical data.

4. **Trust Exploitation**  
   Users may lose trust in a compromised platform.

5. **Regulatory Violations**  
   Breaches involving CSRF attacks may violate data protection laws.

## Key Features of CSRF Attacks

### 1. **Exploitation of Trust**
Leverages the trust between a user’s browser and the target server.

### 2. **Execution of Unauthorized Actions**
Performs actions such as fund transfers, email updates, or password changes.

### 3. **Social Engineering Component**
Requires tricking users into clicking malicious links or visiting attacker-controlled websites.

**Example Malicious Link:**
```html
<img src="https://example.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=attacker" style="display:none;">
```

### 4. **Stealthy Execution**
Uses hidden elements like `iframe`, `img`, or JavaScript to execute requests.

### 5. **Session Token Dependency**
Relies on the victim’s active session with the target application.

## Preventing CSRF Attacks

### 1. **Anti-CSRF Tokens**
Embed unique, unpredictable tokens in requests and verify them server-side.

**Implementation Example:**
```html
<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="random_token_value">
```

### 2. **SameSite Cookies**
Set cookies with the `SameSite` attribute to prevent them from being sent with cross-origin requests.

**Implementation Example:**
```http
Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; SameSite=Strict
```

### 3. **User Authentication Verification**
Confirm the identity of the user before executing critical actions.

### 4. **Custom Headers**
Require custom headers (e.g., `X-Requested-With`) for sensitive requests to ensure they originate from your application.

### 5. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
Restrict content sources to prevent execution of unauthorized scripts.

---

## Detecting CSRF Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Penetration Testing**
Simulate CSRF attacks using tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP.

### 2. **Code Reviews**
Identify missing anti-CSRF measures during application development.

### 3. **Security Scanners**
Use automated tools to detect vulnerable endpoints.

**Recommended Tools:**
- OWASP ZAP  
- Burp Suite  
- Netsparker  

### 4. **User Reports**
Monitor for suspicious activity patterns reported by users.
