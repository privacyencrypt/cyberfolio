## What is ipconfig?

ipconfig (Internet Protocol Configuration) is a command-line utility built into Windows operating systems. It provides detailed information about the network interfaces configured on a device and enables users to manage IP settings, DNS configurations, and network adapters.

Key capabilities of ipconfig include:
- Displaying IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.  
- Releasing and renewing DHCP leases.  
- Flushing and registering DNS records.  

ipconfig is indispensable for diagnosing connectivity issues and ensuring proper network configurations.
