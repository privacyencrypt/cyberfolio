## What is Scanless?

Scanless is an open-source tool designed to anonymize port scanning by using online scanning services. Instead of directly scanning a target, Scanless queries third-party servers to conduct the scan on your behalf.

Key capabilities of Scanless include:
- Anonymous port scanning via third-party services.  
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.  
- Support for multiple online scanning providers.  

Scanless is particularly useful for conducting reconnaissance while minimizing attribution.
