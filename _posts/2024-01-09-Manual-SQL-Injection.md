**SQL Injection (SQLi)** is one of the most common and dangerous vulnerabilities in web applications. It occurs when user inputs are improperly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL statements into queries. Manual SQL Injection techniques provide insight into exploiting these vulnerabilities without relying on automated tools. This blog post explores SQLi, its risks, and detailed steps for manual exploitation. Follow the included **lab walkthrough** for hands-on practice.

## What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection is a web application vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries executed by the database. By exploiting insufficient input validation, attackers can:
- Retrieve sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords.  
- Modify or delete database content.  
- Gain unauthorized administrative access.  
- Execute system commands via the database.

## Why is SQL Injection Dangerous?

SQL Injection can have severe consequences for organizations and users. Here’s why it’s critical:

1. **Data Breaches**  
   Attackers can access sensitive data stored in databases, violating privacy regulations.

2. **Data Manipulation**  
   Unauthorized changes to the database can disrupt business operations.

3. **Privilege Escalation**  
   Gain administrative access to applications or servers.

4. **Application Takeover**  
   Use the vulnerability to inject backdoors or execute commands on the server.

5. **Compliance Violations**  
   Breaches may lead to regulatory fines and reputational damage.

## Key SQL Injection Techniques

### 1. **Union-Based Injection**
Retrieve data by appending a `UNION` statement to the query.

**Example Payload:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --
```

### 2. **Error-Based Injection**
Exploit database error messages to gather information about the structure.

**Example Payload:**
```sql
' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version)) --
```

### 3. **Boolean-Based Blind Injection**
Determine true/false conditions by observing application behavior.

**Example Payload:**
```sql
' AND 1=1 --
' AND 1=2 --
```

### 4. **Time-Based Blind Injection**
Inject queries that cause a delay to infer true/false conditions.

**Example Payload:**
```sql
' IF(1=1) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05' --
```

### 5. **Out-of-Band Injection**
Use external communication, such as DNS queries, to exfiltrate data.

## Preventing SQL Injection

### 1. **Parameterized Queries**
Use prepared statements with bound parameters to prevent injection.

**Example in Python:**
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", (username,))
```

### 2. **Input Validation**
Sanitize and validate all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats.

### 3. **Least Privilege**
Restrict database user permissions to limit the impact of a successful attack.

### 4. **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**
Deploy WAFs to detect and block malicious SQL queries.

### 5. **Regular Security Audits**
Conduct routine code reviews and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.

---

## Detecting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Error Messages**
Look for error messages that disclose database details.

### 2. **Testing Inputs**
Inject special characters (`'`, `"`, `--`) to observe query behavior.

### 3. **Automated Scanners**
Use tools like SQLmap or Burp Suite for comprehensive scans.

### 4. **Code Reviews**
Manually inspect code for unsanitized inputs and unsafe query practices.
