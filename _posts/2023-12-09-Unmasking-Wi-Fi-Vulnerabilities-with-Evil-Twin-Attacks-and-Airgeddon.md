Wireless networks are a common target for attackers, and one of the most effective techniques is the **Evil Twin attack**. By impersonating legitimate Wi-Fi networks, attackers can lure unsuspecting users into connecting to malicious access points. **Airgeddon**, a versatile wireless security testing tool, simplifies the process of conducting Evil Twin attacks while providing features to test and secure wireless networks. In this blog post, we’ll explore the mechanics of Evil Twin attacks, Airgeddon’s capabilities, and how to use this tool effectively. For a practical demonstration, be sure to follow the accompanying **hands-on lab walkthrough**.

## What is an Evil Twin Attack?

An Evil Twin attack involves setting up a rogue wireless access point that mimics a legitimate network. Victims unknowingly connect to the fake network, allowing attackers to intercept sensitive data, perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, or inject malicious payloads.

The success of an Evil Twin attack depends on:
- Mimicking the SSID (network name) of a legitimate access point.  
- Overpowering the signal strength of the legitimate access point.  
- Exploiting user trust and lack of awareness.  

With tools like Airgeddon, conducting and mitigating Evil Twin attacks becomes a structured and educational process for penetration testers.

**Command Example:**  
```bash
./airgeddon.sh --captive-portal
```

### 3. **Signal Amplification**
Overpower the legitimate network’s signal strength to force users to connect to the rogue access point.

### 4. **Network Defense Testing**
Simulate Evil Twin attacks to evaluate the effectiveness of wireless network defenses and user training programs.

### 5. **Comprehensive Wireless Testing**
Combine Evil Twin attacks with other wireless penetration testing techniques, such as WPA/WPA2 cracking or deauthentication attacks.

## Ethical Considerations

Conducting Evil Twin attacks, even for testing purposes, requires strict adherence to ethical guidelines and legal permissions. Unauthorized access or data interception can lead to severe legal consequences. Always obtain explicit permission from the network owner before proceeding. Adhering to standards like the **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)** or **NIST SP 800-115** ensures professionalism and compliance.
