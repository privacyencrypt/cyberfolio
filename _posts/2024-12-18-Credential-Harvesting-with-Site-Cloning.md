Credential harvesting is a common tactic used by attackers to collect usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information from unsuspecting users. By leveraging **site cloning**, attackers can create convincing replicas of legitimate websites to trick users into entering their credentials. This blog post explores the concept of credential harvesting, the tools and techniques used for site cloning, and how penetration testers can use these insights ethically to identify and mitigate such attacks. Be sure to follow the **hands-on lab walkthrough** for a practical demonstration.

## What is Credential Harvesting?

Credential harvesting refers to the unauthorized collection of login information, often through phishing or social engineering techniques. Attackers replicate legitimate websites, redirect users to the fake sites, and capture the credentials entered by the victims.

Key components of credential harvesting include:
- Cloning legitimate websites to create deceptive replicas.  
- Redirecting traffic to the cloned sites via phishing emails or malicious links.  
- Collecting sensitive user data entered into the cloned forms.  

By understanding these tactics, penetration testers can identify vulnerabilities and develop strategies to prevent such attacks.

## Why Use Site Cloning for Testing?

Site cloning is a powerful method for understanding the mechanics of credential harvesting and testing the effectiveness of defenses. Here’s why it’s essential for penetration testing:

1. **Realistic Attack Simulations**  
   Site cloning allows testers to replicate real-world attack scenarios, providing actionable insights into the target’s vulnerabilities.

2. **User Awareness Training**  
   Simulated attacks help organizations educate users about phishing and credential harvesting tactics.

3. **Identifying Vulnerabilities**  
   Testing reveals weaknesses in email filtering, URL scanning, and user training programs.

4. **Ethical Testing**  
   With explicit permission, site cloning provides a controlled environment to evaluate security measures.

5. **Improving Defenses**  
   Insights from these tests enable organizations to implement stronger safeguards against credential harvesting attacks.

## Key Tools for Site Cloning

### 1. **Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)**
A popular tool for cloning websites and crafting phishing campaigns.

**Command Example:**  
```bash
setoolkit
```
Follow the prompts to clone a site and capture credentials.

### 2. **HTTrack**
A website copier that downloads and replicates entire websites for offline use or testing.

**Command Example:**  
```bash
httrack http://example.com
```

### 3. **BlackEye**
An open-source phishing tool designed to clone websites and capture credentials.

**Command Example:**  
```bash
bash blackeye.sh
```

## Common Steps in Credential Harvesting Testing

### 1. **Clone the Target Website**
Replicate the appearance and functionality of a legitimate website using tools like SET or HTTrack.

### 2. **Set Up a Phishing Page**
Host the cloned website on a local or cloud-based server and include forms to capture user credentials.

### 3. **Redirect Traffic**
Use phishing emails or malicious links to redirect users to the cloned site.

### 4. **Capture Credentials**
Monitor the cloned site to collect any credentials entered by users.

### 5. **Analyze Results**
Evaluate the effectiveness of defenses and identify gaps in user awareness or technical safeguards.

## Ethical Considerations

Credential harvesting testing requires strict adherence to ethical guidelines and legal permissions. Unauthorized cloning of websites or data collection is illegal and unethical. Always obtain explicit consent from the target organization and follow industry standards, such as the **OWASP Testing Guide** or **NIST SP 800-115**.
