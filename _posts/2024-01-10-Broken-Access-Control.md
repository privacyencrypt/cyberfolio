**Broken Access Control** is a critical security vulnerability that allows unauthorized users to access resources or perform actions beyond their intended privileges. As one of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, broken access control is a significant threat to web applications and systems. This blog post explores the nature of broken access control, its risks, and practical measures for detection and prevention. Follow the included **lab walkthrough** for hands-on practice.

## What is Broken Access Control?

Access control mechanisms enforce restrictions on what users can access or perform within an application. Broken access control occurs when these mechanisms are improperly implemented, enabling attackers to bypass restrictions.

Key characteristics of broken access control:
- Exploits flaws in authentication and authorization processes.  
- Can lead to privilege escalation, data exposure, and system compromise.  
- Often results from misconfigurations or overlooked logic flaws.

## Why is Broken Access Control Dangerous?

Broken access control can have severe consequences for organizations and users. Here’s why it’s a critical issue:

1. **Data Breaches**  
   Unauthorized users may access sensitive information, violating privacy regulations.

2. **Privilege Escalation**  
   Attackers can gain administrative control over systems or applications.

3. **Resource Abuse**  
   Unauthorized actions, such as transferring funds or altering data, can disrupt operations.

4. **Compliance Violations**  
   Breaches involving broken access control may violate laws like GDPR or HIPAA.

5. **Reputation Damage**  
   Publicly disclosed breaches erode trust and credibility.

## Key Features of Broken Access Control Exploits

### 1. **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)**
Accessing objects directly by manipulating IDs in URLs or requests.

**Example Exploit:**
```http
GET /user/12345/profile  
Modify to: GET /user/12346/profile
```

### 2. **Privilege Escalation**
Gaining elevated permissions by bypassing role-based access controls.

### 3. **Path Traversal**
Accessing restricted directories or files through manipulated paths.

**Example Exploit:**
```http
GET /../../etc/passwd
```

### 4. **Unprotected APIs**
Accessing sensitive functions or data through poorly secured endpoints.

### 5. **Missing Authorization Checks**
Performing restricted actions due to a lack of proper verification.

---

## Preventing Broken Access Control

### 1. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
Ensure that permissions are assigned based on user roles.

### 2. **Enforce Principle of Least Privilege**
Grant users only the permissions necessary for their tasks.

### 3. **Validate Input and Output**
Sanitize user inputs and verify responses to prevent unauthorized access.

### 4. **Log and Monitor Access Events**
Record access attempts and anomalies to detect unauthorized activity.

### 5. **Regular Security Audits**
Conduct code reviews and penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

---

## Detecting Broken Access Control

### 1. **Manual Testing**
Simulate attacks by manipulating request parameters or session tokens.

### 2. **Automated Scanning**
Use tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or Acunetix to detect access control flaws.

### 3. **Penetration Testing**
Test applications for privilege escalation, IDOR, and other access control issues.

### 4. **Access Control Matrix**
Map and review access control rules to ensure consistency and coverage.

### 5. **User Reports**
Monitor for suspicious activity reported by users or identified in logs.
