# Setting Up Your Own Kali Linux Virtual Machine

## **Objective**
Learn how to set up a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM) using VirtualBox. This lab covers downloading Kali Linux, configuring VirtualBox, and installing the OS on your virtual machine.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **VirtualBox Installed on Your System**:
   - Download and install VirtualBox from the official website: [https://www.virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org).

2. **Kali Linux ISO or Virtual Machine Image**:
   - Download from the official Kali Linux website: [https://www.kali.org/get-kali/](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/).
   - Choose either the **Installer ISO** or the **VirtualBox VM Image**.

3. **Sufficient System Resources**:
   - Ensure your host system has at least:
     - 4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended).
     - 20 GB of free disk space.
     - A 64-bit processor with virtualization support enabled in the BIOS.

---

## **Step 1: Setting Up VirtualBox**
1. Open VirtualBox and click **New** to create a new virtual machine.
2. Configure the VM settings:
   - **Name**: Enter a name for your VM (e.g., `Kali Linux`).
   - **Type**: Select `Linux`.
   - **Version**: Choose `Debian (64-bit)`.

3. Click **Next** and allocate memory:
   - Assign at least 2 GB of RAM (2048 MB). More is better if your system can handle it.

4. Click **Next** to create a virtual hard disk:
   - Select **Create a virtual hard disk now** and click **Create**.
   - Choose **VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)** and click **Next**.
   - Select **Dynamically allocated** and click **Next**.
   - Set the disk size to at least 20 GB and click **Create**.

---

## **Step 2: Configuring the VM**
1. Select your newly created VM and click **Settings**.
2. Configure the following:
   - **System**:
     - In the **Processor** tab, allocate at least 2 CPUs.
     - Enable **Hardware Virtualization** if available.
   - **Display**:
     - Increase **Video Memory** to at least 64 MB.
   - **Storage**:
     - Click the **Empty** disk under **Controller: IDE**.
     - Click the disk icon on the right and choose **Choose a disk file**.
     - Select the downloaded Kali Linux ISO file.
   - **Network**:
     - Set **Attached to** to `NAT` for internet access.

3. Click **OK** to save the settings.

---

## **Step 3: Installing Kali Linux**
1. Start the VM by clicking **Start** in VirtualBox.
2. The Kali Linux boot menu will appear. Select **Graphical install** and press **Enter**.
3. Follow the on-screen installation steps:
   - **Language**: Choose your preferred language.
   - **Location**: Select your location.
   - **Keyboard**: Choose your keyboard layout.
   - **Network**:
     - Configure the hostname (e.g., `kali`).
     - Set a domain name if applicable.
   - **User Account**:
     - Create a non-root user and password.
   - **Disk Partitioning**:
     - Choose **Guided - use entire disk**.
     - Select your virtual disk and choose **All files in one partition**.
     - Confirm the partitioning changes and write them to the disk.

4. Wait for the installation to complete and reboot the VM when prompted.

---

## **Step 4: Post-Installation Setup**
1. Log in to your new Kali Linux installation using the credentials you created.
2. Update the system:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
3. Install VirtualBox Guest Additions for improved performance:
   - Mount the Guest Additions ISO:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-x11
     ```
   - Reboot the VM:
     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     ```

---

## **Step 5: Networking and Shared Folders (Optional)**
### **Enable Bridged Networking**
1. Shut down the VM and go to **Settings > Network**.
2. Change **Attached to** to `Bridged Adapter`.
3. Start the VM to connect it directly to your hostâ€™s network.

### **Set Up Shared Folders**
1. In **Settings > Shared Folders**, click the **+** icon.
2. Add a folder from your host system and select **Auto-mount**.
3. Access the shared folder in Kali Linux:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t vboxsf <folder_name> /mnt
   ```

---

## **Step 6: Troubleshooting Common Issues**
1. **Slow Performance**:
   - Increase RAM and CPU allocation.
   - Enable Virtualization in your BIOS settings.

2. **No Internet Access**:
   - Ensure the network adapter is set to `NAT` or `Bridged`.

3. **Screen Resolution Issues**:
   - Install VirtualBox Guest Additions as mentioned in Step 4.

4. **ISO Not Detected**:
   - Recheck the storage settings and ensure the ISO is correctly attached.

---

## **Additional Tips and Insights**
1. **Snapshots**:
   - Use snapshots in VirtualBox to save the current state of your VM before making major changes.

2. **Tool Installation**:
   - Kali Linux comes pre-installed with many tools. Use `kali-linux-large` or `kali-linux-everything` metapackages to install additional tools.

3. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep your Kali Linux system updated to access the latest features and security patches.

4. **Use in a Lab**:
   - Combine Kali Linux with other VMs in VirtualBox for a controlled penetration testing lab.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. Setting up Kali Linux in VirtualBox provides a secure and flexible environment for penetration testing and learning.
2. Understanding basic VM configurations ensures smooth installation and operation.
3. Regular updates and proper resource allocation are crucial for an optimal experience.
