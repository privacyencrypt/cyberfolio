# Web Server Vulnerability Scanning with ZAP

## **Objective**
Learn how to use **OWASP ZAP** (Zed Attack Proxy), a popular open-source security tool, to identify vulnerabilities in web servers and applications, and understand how to analyze and remediate the findings.

---

## **Purpose**
OWASP ZAP is a powerful tool for web application security testing. It helps identify vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, security misconfigurations, and missing security headers. This lab guides you through scanning a web server using ZAP and interpreting the results.

---

## **Tools Required**
- **OWASP ZAP**: Installed on Kali Linux or any supported system.
- A test web application or server (e.g., DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop, or a locally hosted application).

---

## **Lab Topology**
- **Kali Linux**: Running OWASP ZAP.
- **Target Web Server**: A test or vulnerable application to scan.

---

## **Walkthrough**

### **Task 1: Setting Up OWASP ZAP**
1. **Install OWASP ZAP**:
   - OWASP ZAP is pre-installed on Kali Linux. To verify, run:
     ```bash
     zaproxy -version
     ```
   - If not installed, install it using:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install zaproxy -y
     ```

2. **Launch OWASP ZAP**:
   - Start ZAP from the terminal:
     ```bash
     zaproxy
     ```
   - Alternatively, open it from the applications menu.

3. **Set Up Browser Proxy**:
   - Configure your browser to route traffic through ZAP.
     - Proxy settings:
       - HTTP Proxy: `127.0.0.1`
       - Port: `8080`
   - Install the ZAP certificate in your browser for HTTPS interception.

---

### **Task 2: Scanning a Web Server**
1. **Identify the Target**:
   - Choose the target URL (e.g., `http://<target_ip>`).

2. **Run a Passive Scan**:
   - Enter the target URL in the **URL to attack** field in ZAP’s main window.
   - Click **Attack** to start a passive scan.

3. **Run an Active Scan**:
   - Right-click on the target in the **Sites** tab and select **Attack > Active Scan**.
   - Configure the scan scope and click **Start Scan**.

4. **Monitor the Scan**:
   - View progress in the **Active Scan** tab.
   - ZAP will test for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and more.

---

### **Task 3: Interpreting Results**
1. **View Alerts**:
   - Navigate to the **Alerts** tab to see identified vulnerabilities.
   - Alerts are categorized by severity (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

2. **Analyze Findings**:
   - Example output:
     - High: SQL Injection detected in `/login.php`.
     - Medium: Missing `X-Frame-Options` header.
     - Low: Server discloses version information in HTTP headers.

3. **Expand Alert Details**:
   - Click on an alert to view detailed information, including:
     - Description of the issue.
     - Steps to reproduce.
     - Recommended remediation actions.

---

### **Task 4: Remediating Vulnerabilities**
1. **Fix High-Severity Issues First**:
   - Example: If SQL Injection is detected:
     - Use parameterized queries to sanitize user input.
     - Validate and escape all user inputs.

2. **Add Missing Security Headers**:
   - Configure the web server to include headers like:
     - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
     - `Content-Security-Policy`

3. **Restrict Server Information Disclosure**:
   - Disable version headers in the server configuration (e.g., Apache or Nginx).

4. **Re-Scan After Fixing**:
   - Run another scan to verify that vulnerabilities have been resolved.

---

### **Task 5: Advanced Features**
1. **Spidering the Target**:
   - Use the spider tool to discover all linked pages and resources.
     - In the toolbar, click on **Spider** and enter the target URL.

2. **Fuzzing Inputs**:
   - Use the **Fuzzer** tool to test inputs for vulnerabilities.
     - Right-click on a request in the history tab and select **Attack > Fuzz**.
     - Add payloads and start the fuzzing process.

3. **Using the API**:
   - Automate scans with ZAP’s REST API.
     - Documentation available at: [ZAP API Guide](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/api/).

---

## **Best Practices**
1. **Run ZAP on Authorized Targets Only**:
   - Ensure you have explicit permission to scan the target.

2. **Combine Tools for Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Use ZAP alongside other tools like Nikto, Burp Suite, or Nessus.

3. **Document and Prioritize Findings**:
   - Keep a record of vulnerabilities, their impact, and remediation status.

4. **Educate Development Teams**:
   - Train developers on secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. OWASP ZAP is a powerful tool for identifying and mitigating web application vulnerabilities.
2. Regular scans help maintain the security of web servers and applications.
3. Addressing ZAP’s findings reduces the risk of exploitation.

---

## **Troubleshooting Tips**
1. **ZAP Cannot Intercept HTTPS Traffic**:
   - Ensure the ZAP certificate is installed in your browser.
   - Verify browser proxy settings.

2. **Slow Scans**:
   - Limit the scan scope to specific directories or parameters.

3. **Missing Alerts**:
   - Check the scan scope and ensure all relevant pages are included.
   - Use spidering to discover hidden or unlinked resources.

By completing this lab, you now understand how to use OWASP ZAP to identify vulnerabilities in web servers and secure them effectively.
