# Lab 7: Using Burp Suite to Intercept Client-Side Requests

## **Objective**
Learn how to use **Burp Suite**, a powerful web application security testing tool, to intercept and analyze HTTP/S requests between a client (browser) and a server. This lab demonstrates how attackers and penetration testers can inspect and manipulate traffic.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Kali Linux or Any Linux Distro with Burp Suite Installed**:
   - Verify Burp Suite is installed:
     ```bash
     burpsuite --version
     ```
   - Install it if necessary:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install burpsuite
     ```

2. **Web Browser**:
   - Install a browser extension or configure your browser to work with Burp Suite as a proxy (e.g., Firefox or Chrome).

3. **Basic Understanding of HTTP Requests and Responses**:
   - Familiarity with GET, POST, headers, and cookies is helpful.

---

## **Step 1: Launching Burp Suite**
1. Open Burp Suite from your terminal or application menu:
   ```bash
   burpsuite
   ```
2. Select **Temporary Project** and click **Next**.
3. Choose the **Use Burp Defaults** option and click **Start Burp**.
4. Once Burp Suite is open, navigate to the **Proxy** tab and ensure the **Intercept** sub-tab is selected.

---

## **Step 2: Configuring Your Browser to Use Burp as a Proxy**
1. Open your browser’s network settings.
2. Configure the proxy settings to match Burp Suite's default settings:
   - **HTTP Proxy**: `127.0.0.1`
   - **Port**: `8080`
3. Disable proxy for localhost (if applicable).

4. Install Burp's CA certificate:
   - Navigate to `http://burp` in your browser.
   - Download and install the Burp CA certificate to ensure HTTPS requests are intercepted properly.

   - **Tip**: Installing the certificate enables Burp to decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic.

---

## **Step 3: Intercepting Requests**
1. Open a website in your browser (e.g., `http://example.com`).
2. Check the **Proxy > Intercept** tab in Burp Suite:
   - The HTTP request will appear here, waiting for your action.
3. Modify or forward the request:
   - Click **Forward** to send the request to the server as is.
   - Click **Drop** to discard the request.

   - **Insight**: Modifying requests allows you to test how the server handles unexpected or malicious input.

---

## **Step 4: Using the HTTP History Tab**
1. Navigate to the **HTTP history** tab under **Proxy**.
2. View all intercepted requests and responses:
   - Click on a request to inspect details like headers, parameters, and body.

   - **Tip**: Use this tab to analyze how data flows between the client and server.

---

## **Step 5: Repeating and Testing Requests**
1. Right-click on a request in the HTTP history and select **Send to Repeater**.
2. Navigate to the **Repeater** tab.
3. Modify the request as needed and click **Send**.
4. Review the response:
   - Test how the server reacts to different inputs.
   - **Insight**: Repeater is invaluable for testing vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

---

## **Step 6: Automating Testing with Burp Scanner**
1. Send a request to the **Scanner** by right-clicking on it in the HTTP history.
2. Navigate to the **Scanner** tab to view scan results.
3. Analyze potential vulnerabilities identified by Burp, such as:
   - SQL injection.
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS).
   - Insecure cookies.

   - **Tip**: The Scanner is part of Burp Suite Professional, so free users may have limited functionality.

---

## **Step 7: Cleaning Up**
1. Disable the proxy in your browser settings when you’re done.
2. Close Burp Suite to terminate the proxy server.
3. Remove the Burp CA certificate if it was installed temporarily.

---

## **Additional Tips and Insights**
1. **Ethical Use**:
   - Only intercept and test traffic for applications you own or have explicit permission to test.
   - **Insight**: Unauthorized interception of traffic is illegal and unethical.

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Explore other tools in Burp Suite, such as the Intruder (for automated attacks) and Sequencer (for analyzing randomness).

3. **HTTPS Troubleshooting**:
   - If HTTPS traffic is not intercepted, double-check the proxy configuration and CA certificate installation.

4. **Filter Traffic**:
   - Use filters in the Proxy tab to focus on specific requests or exclude irrelevant traffic.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. Burp Suite is a powerful tool for analyzing and manipulating HTTP/S traffic.
2. Interception allows you to understand and test how web applications handle client requests.
3. Responsible use and adherence to ethical guidelines are critical for using Burp Suite effectively.
