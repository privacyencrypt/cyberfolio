# Monitoring Wi-Fi Signals with Kismet

## **Objective**
Learn how to use **Kismet**, a wireless network monitoring tool, to capture and analyze Wi-Fi signals and understand how to monitor network activity effectively.

---

## **Purpose**
Kismet is a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing Wi-Fi signals. It passively detects wireless networks, devices, and their activity without actively transmitting. This lab demonstrates how to use Kismet to monitor Wi-Fi signals and gain insights into network activity.

---

## **Tools Required**
- **Kali Linux** (or any Linux distribution with Kismet installed).
- A Wi-Fi adapter capable of monitor mode (e.g., Alfa AWUS036NHA).

---

## **Lab Topology**
- **Kali Linux**: Running Kismet.
- **Wi-Fi Network**: Target network(s) to monitor.

---

## **Walkthrough**

### **Task 1: Installing Kismet**
1. **Verify Installation**:
   - Check if Kismet is installed:
     ```bash
     kismet -v
     ```
   - If not installed, install it using:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install kismet -y
     ```

2. **Start Kismet**:
   - Launch Kismet:
     ```bash
     sudo kismet
     ```
   - Open a browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://localhost:2501
     ```

---

### **Task 2: Configuring Kismet**
1. **Set Up Wi-Fi Adapter**:
   - Ensure your Wi-Fi adapter supports monitor mode.
   - Identify the adapter using:
     ```bash
     iwconfig
     ```

2. **Enable Monitor Mode**:
   - Put the adapter into monitor mode:
     ```bash
     sudo ip link set <interface> down
     sudo iw <interface> set monitor control
     sudo ip link set <interface> up
     ```
     Replace `<interface>` with your Wi-Fi adapter name (e.g., `wlan0`).

3. **Add the Wi-Fi Source to Kismet**:
   - Configure the adapter in the Kismet interface:
     - Navigate to **Sources > Add Source**.
     - Select your Wi-Fi adapter from the list.
     - Click **Add Source**.

---

### **Task 3: Capturing Wi-Fi Signals**
1. **Start Capturing**:
   - Once the source is added, Kismet will begin capturing Wi-Fi signals.
   - View live data in the **Networks** tab.

2. **Monitor Networks**:
   - Observe networks detected in your area.
   - Key details:
     - SSID: Network name.
     - BSSID: MAC address of the access point.
     - Channel: Frequency channel used by the network.
     - Signal Strength: Indicates proximity to the network.

3. **Identify Connected Devices**:
   - Navigate to the **Devices** tab to view clients connected to access points.
   - Look for details like device MAC addresses and manufacturer information.

---

### **Task 4: Analyzing Captured Data**
1. **Save Captured Data**:
   - Save the session for later analysis:
     ```bash
     sudo kismet -c <interface>,<file_name>.kismet
     ```
     Replace `<interface>` with your Wi-Fi adapter name and `<file_name>` with a desired filename.

2. **View Traffic Details**:
   - Analyze captured packets directly in Kismet or export them for use with tools like Wireshark:
     ```bash
     wireshark <file_name>.pcap
     ```

3. **Look for Anomalies**:
   - Identify unusual activity such as hidden networks, unauthorized devices, or overlapping channels.

---

### **Task 5: Securing Wi-Fi Networks**
1. **Use Strong Encryption**:
   - Ensure your network uses WPA3 or WPA2 encryption.

2. **Disable WPS**:
   - Turn off Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) to prevent brute-force attacks.

3. **Monitor for Rogue Devices**:
   - Use tools like Kismet to regularly check for unauthorized access points or devices.

4. **Change Default Settings**:
   - Modify the default SSID and admin credentials of your access point.

5. **Enable MAC Filtering** (Optional):
   - Restrict access to known devices using MAC filtering.

---

## **Best Practices**
1. **Use Authorized Devices Only**:
   - Ensure you have permission to monitor Wi-Fi networks.

2. **Combine Tools**:
   - Use Kismet alongside other tools like Aircrack-ng for comprehensive wireless security testing.

3. **Document Findings**:
   - Record observations for security audits or troubleshooting.

4. **Regularly Update Tools**:
   - Keep Kismet and other tools updated to detect new vulnerabilities.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. Kismet is a passive tool for monitoring Wi-Fi signals and detecting network activity.
2. Regular monitoring helps identify vulnerabilities and unauthorized devices.
3. Securing Wi-Fi networks involves encryption, monitoring, and restricting access.

---

## **Troubleshooting Tips**
1. **No Networks Detected**:
   - Ensure the Wi-Fi adapter is in monitor mode.
   - Check if the correct interface is added as a source in Kismet.

2. **Kismet Interface Not Loading**:
   - Restart Kismet and verify that port `2501` is accessible.

3. **Adapter Compatibility Issues**:
   - Confirm that your Wi-Fi adapter supports monitor mode and packet injection.

By completing this lab, you now understand how to use Kismet to monitor Wi-Fi signals and ensure network security.
