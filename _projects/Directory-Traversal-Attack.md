# Directory Traversal Attack

## **Objective**
Learn how to perform and understand directory traversal attacks, a vulnerability that allows attackers to access restricted directories and execute unauthorized commands. This lab demonstrates identifying, exploiting, and mitigating directory traversal vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Testing Environment**:
   - Set up a vulnerable web application using tools like **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** or **bWAPP**.

2. **Linux Environment**:
   - A Linux system or virtual machine with administrative privileges.

3. **Basic Networking and Web Knowledge**:
   - Familiarity with HTTP requests, web servers, and file systems.

4. **Burp Suite Installed** (Optional):
   - For advanced interception and testing.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding Directory Traversal**
1. **What is Directory Traversal?**
   - An attack that exploits improper validation of user-supplied input.
   - Allows access to restricted directories, potentially exposing sensitive files like `passwd` or `config`.

2. **Common Indicators**:
   - URL or form fields accepting file paths (e.g., `?file=example.txt`).
   - Improperly sanitized user input.

3. **Key Payloads**:
   - Relative paths with `../` to navigate directories.
   - Example:
     ```
     ../../../../etc/passwd
     ```

---

## **Step 2: Identifying Vulnerabilities**
1. **Locate Input Fields**:
   - Look for parameters that accept file paths (e.g., `?file=` or `?page=`).

2. **Basic Testing**:
   - Submit payloads like `../` or `../../etc/passwd` to the input field.
   - Observe the response for indications of success (e.g., readable content or errors).

3. **Intercept Requests** (Optional):
   - Use **Burp Suite** to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
   - Add payloads to test for traversal.

Example Request:
```http
GET /vulnerable_app/?file=../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

---

## **Step 3: Exploiting the Vulnerability**
1. **Access Sensitive Files**:
   - Try payloads to access system files like:
     ```
     ../../../../etc/passwd
     ../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
     ```

2. **Enumerate Application Files**:
   - Check for configuration files:
     ```
     ../../../../var/www/html/config.php
     ../../../../config/settings.yml
     ```

3. **Leverage File Inclusion**:
   - If the application supports file execution, attempt to execute malicious code.

---

## **Step 4: Mitigating Directory Traversal**
1. **Validate Input**:
   - Use a whitelist of acceptable inputs.
   - Reject suspicious characters like `../` and `..\`.

2. **Sanitize User Input**:
   - Normalize paths before processing.
   - Remove relative path characters.

3. **Use Secure APIs**:
   - Employ APIs that restrict file access to specific directories.
   - Example: PHP's `realpath()`.

4. **Least Privilege Principle**:
   - Run applications with minimal permissions.

5. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Regularly check logs for suspicious activity involving directory traversal attempts.

---

## **Step 5: Practical Exercise**
### **Using DVWA**
1. Set the DVWA security level to **Low**.
2. Navigate to the **File Inclusion** section.
3. Test payloads:
   ```
   ../../../../etc/passwd
   ../../../../var/www/html/config.php
   ```

### **Using Burp Suite**
1. Intercept a request with a file path parameter.
2. Modify the path to include traversal payloads.
3. Observe the response for indications of success.

---

## **Additional Tips and Insights**
1. **Automated Scanners**:
   - Use tools like **Nikto** or **OWASP ZAP** to identify directory traversal vulnerabilities.

2. **Custom Payloads**:
   - Experiment with encoding techniques:
     - URL Encoding: `..%2F..%2F`.
     - Double Encoding: `%252e%252e%252f`.

3. **Cross-Check Vulnerabilities**:
   - Validate results with manual testing to confirm exploitation.

4. **Regular Updates**:
   - Patch and update web applications to address known vulnerabilities.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. Directory traversal exploits improper validation of user input to access restricted files.
2. Testing involves submitting relative path payloads and observing the applicationâ€™s response.
3. Implement input validation, sanitization, and secure APIs to mitigate the risk of traversal attacks.
4. Always test in authorized environments to ensure ethical compliance.
