# Spoofing Your MAC Address with macchanger

## **Objective**
Learn how to use **macchanger** to spoof your MAC address for privacy, testing, or bypassing MAC-based network restrictions.

---

## **Purpose**
A **MAC address** (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces. Spoofing your MAC address can:
- Enhance privacy by masking your original hardware address.
- Bypass MAC filtering on networks.
- Test network security configurations.

**macchanger** is a Linux tool designed to simplify MAC address spoofing.

---

## **Tools Required**
- A Linux system (e.g., Kali Linux) with **macchanger** installed.

---

## **Lab Topology**
- Single Linux machine with administrative/root access.
- A network interface card (e.g., `wlan0` for wireless, `eth0` for Ethernet).

---

## **Walkthrough**

### **Task 1: Installing macchanger**
1. **Check if macchanger is installed**:
   ```bash
   macchanger --version
   ```
2. **Install macchanger if not available**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install macchanger
   ```
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   macchanger --help
   ```

---

### **Task 2: Viewing Your Current MAC Address**
1. Identify your network interfaces:
   ```bash
   ip link
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
       link/ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
   ```
   - Note the interface name (e.g., `eth0`).

2. Display the current MAC address:
   ```bash
   macchanger -s <interface>
   ```
   - Replace `<interface>` with your network interface (e.g., `eth0`).

   Example:
   ```bash
   macchanger -s eth0
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Current MAC: 00:11:22:33:44:55 (Intel Corporation)
   ```

---

### **Task 3: Spoofing Your MAC Address**
#### **Step 1: Bring Down the Network Interface**
To modify the MAC address, you must disable the network interface:
```bash
sudo ip link set <interface> down
```
Example:
```bash
sudo ip link set eth0 down
```

#### **Step 2: Change the MAC Address**
1. **Set a Random MAC Address**:
   ```bash
   sudo macchanger -r <interface>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   sudo macchanger -r eth0
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Current MAC: 00:11:22:33:44:55 (Intel Corporation)
   Permanent MAC: 00:11:22:33:44:55 (Intel Corporation)
   New MAC: 22:33:44:55:66:77 (Unknown)
   ```

2. **Set a Specific MAC Address**:
   ```bash
   sudo macchanger -m <new_mac> <interface>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   sudo macchanger -m 22:33:44:55:66:77 eth0
   ```

3. **Restore the Original MAC Address**:
   ```bash
   sudo macchanger -p <interface>
   ```

#### **Step 3: Bring the Network Interface Back Up**
Enable the interface after changing the MAC address:
```bash
sudo ip link set <interface> up
```
Example:
```bash
sudo ip link set eth0 up
```

#### **Step 4: Verify the New MAC Address**
Check the updated MAC address:
```bash
macchanger -s <interface>
```
Example:
```bash
macchanger -s eth0
```
Output:
```bash
Current MAC: 22:33:44:55:66:77 (Unknown)
```

---

### **Task 4: Testing the New MAC Address**
1. Test connectivity:
   ```bash
   ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
   ```
   - Ensure the network interface works with the spoofed MAC address.

2. Use `ip a` to confirm the MAC address is active:
   ```bash
   ip a
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   link/ether 22:33:44:55:66:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
   ```

---

## **Best Practices**
1. **Use Random MAC Addresses**:
   - Regularly change your MAC address to enhance privacy.

2. **Test Network Connectivity**:
   - Ensure the new MAC address does not interfere with DHCP or network access.

3. **Document Changes**:
   - Record the original MAC address before spoofing for troubleshooting.

4. **Understand Ethical Implications**:
   - Only spoof your MAC address for ethical purposes or with proper authorization.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. MAC address spoofing is a useful technique for enhancing privacy or bypassing network restrictions.
2. **macchanger** simplifies the process of viewing, modifying, and restoring MAC addresses.
3. Always follow ethical guidelines and test in controlled environments to avoid unintended consequences.

## **Troubleshooting Tips**
1. **Interface Not Coming Back Up**:
   - Ensure you use `sudo` when bringing the interface back up.
   - Verify the interface status with:
     ```bash
     ip link
     ```

2. **Network Connectivity Issues**:
   - Restart your network service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart networking
     ```
   - Renew the DHCP lease:
     ```bash
     sudo dhclient <interface>
     ```

3. **MAC Address Not Changing**:
   - Ensure the network interface is down before modifying the MAC address.
   - Double-check the syntax of the `macchanger` command.

4. **Permission Denied**:
   - Use `sudo` for all macchanger commands.

By completing this lab, you now understand how to spoof and restore MAC addresses using macchanger.
