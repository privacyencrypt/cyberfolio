# Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment with Sn1per

## **Objective**
Learn how to use **Sn1per**, an automated vulnerability assessment and pentesting tool, to gather intelligence, scan for vulnerabilities, and analyze results effectively.

---

## **Purpose**
Sn1per automates many tasks in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, including reconnaissance, web application testing, and network scanning. This lab demonstrates how to perform a comprehensive assessment with Sn1per and analyze the findings.

---

## **Tools Required**
- **Kali Linux** (or any Linux distribution with Sn1per installed).
- A target IP or domain for testing (ensure proper authorization).

---

## **Lab Topology**
- **Kali Linux**: Running Sn1per.
- **Target System**: A test server or web application.

---

## **Walkthrough**

### **Task 1: Installing Sn1per**
1. **Verify Installation**:
   - Check if Sn1per is installed:
     ```bash
     sniper -v
     ```
   - If not installed, clone and install Sn1per from GitHub:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/1N3/Sn1per
     cd Sn1per
     sudo bash install.sh
     ```

2. **Launch Sn1per**:
   - Run Sn1per to verify the installation:
     ```bash
     sniper
     ```

---

### **Task 2: Setting Up the Target**
1. **Determine the Target**:
   - Identify the target domain or IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100` or `example.com`).

2. **Choose the Scan Type**:
   - Sn1per supports various modes:
     - **Basic**: Standard scan.
     - **Web**: Focused on web application vulnerabilities.
     - **Full**: Comprehensive scanning with all options enabled.
     - **Stealth**: Minimizes noise to avoid detection.

---

### **Task 3: Running Sn1per Scans**
1. **Basic Scan**:
   - Perform a standard reconnaissance and vulnerability scan:
     ```bash
     sniper -t <target>
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     sniper -t 192.168.1.100
     ```

2. **Web Application Scan**:
   - Focus on web application vulnerabilities:
     ```bash
     sniper -t <target> -m web
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     sniper -t example.com -m web
     ```

3. **Full Scan**:
   - Perform a comprehensive scan:
     ```bash
     sniper -t <target> -m full
     ```

4. **Stealth Scan**:
   - Conduct a low-noise scan:
     ```bash
     sniper -t <target> -m stealth
     ```

5. **Custom Scan**:
   - Use additional options for specific needs (e.g., port scanning, directory brute-forcing):
     ```bash
     sniper -t <target> -p <ports>
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     sniper -t 192.168.1.100 -p 80,443
     ```

---

### **Task 4: Analyzing Results**
1. **View Scan Reports**:
   - Navigate to the Sn1per reports directory:
     ```bash
     cd /usr/share/sniper/reports/<target>
     ```

2. **Analyze Findings**:
   - Review the detailed output for:
     - Open ports and services.
     - Vulnerabilities in web applications.
     - Misconfigurations or outdated software.

3. **Cross-Reference Vulnerabilities**:
   - Use the provided CVE information to research vulnerabilities and remediation steps.

---

### **Task 5: Securing the Target**
1. **Patch Vulnerabilities**:
   - Apply updates or patches for identified issues.

2. **Restrict Open Ports**:
   - Use a firewall to block unnecessary ports and services.

3. **Harden Web Applications**:
   - Implement security headers, strong authentication, and input validation.

4. **Conduct Regular Scans**:
   - Schedule periodic scans to ensure ongoing security.

---

## **Best Practices**
1. **Use Authorized Targets Only**:
   - Ensure you have explicit permission to scan the target.

2. **Combine Tools**:
   - Use Sn1per alongside other tools like Nmap, Nikto, or Burp Suite for comprehensive assessments.

3. **Document Findings**:
   - Maintain detailed records of vulnerabilities and remediation actions.

4. **Regularly Update Tools**:
   - Keep Sn1per and other tools up to date to detect the latest vulnerabilities.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. Sn1per automates many aspects of vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
2. Regular scans and analysis help maintain the security of networks and applications.
3. Addressing Sn1perâ€™s findings reduces the attack surface and minimizes risks.

---

## **Troubleshooting Tips**
1. **Scan Fails to Start**:
   - Verify the target is reachable.
   - Ensure Sn1per is installed correctly.

2. **No Results from Scan**:
   - Check the scan type and ensure the target has active services.
   - Use verbose mode (`-v`) for detailed output.

3. **Slow Scans**:
   - Limit the scope of the scan (e.g., specific ports or directories).
   - Ensure sufficient system resources are available.

By completing this lab, you now understand how to use Sn1per for vulnerability assessments and how to secure systems based on the findings.
