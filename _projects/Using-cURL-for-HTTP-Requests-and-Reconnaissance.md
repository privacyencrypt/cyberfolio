# Using cURL for HTTP Requests and Reconnaissance

## **Objective**
Learn how to use **cURL**, a command-line tool, to send HTTP requests and retrieve information from web servers. This lab demonstrates how attackers and penetration testers use cURL for reconnaissance and testing web applications.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Linux/Windows/macOS with cURL Installed**:
   - Verify cURL is installed:
     ```bash
     curl --version
     ```
   - Install it if necessary:
     - On Linux:
       ```bash
       sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
       ```
     - On macOS (via Homebrew):
       ```bash
       brew install curl
       ```
     - On Windows, download it from [cURL official website](https://curl.se/).

2. **Basic Understanding of HTTP Requests**:
   - Familiarity with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and headers.

3. **Target Website**:
   - Use a controlled website or testing environment for this lab.

---

## **Step 1: Basic cURL Usage**
1. Fetch a webpage using the GET method:
   ```bash
   curl http://example.com
   ```
2. Observe the response:
   - HTML source code of the webpage will be displayed in the terminal.

   **Tip**: Use `--silent` to suppress progress details.

---

## **Step 2: Viewing HTTP Headers**
1. Display only the headers of the response:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://example.com
   ```
   - **`-I`**: Sends a HEAD request to fetch headers only.
2. Observe key headers:
   - `Server`: Type of server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
   - `Content-Type`: Format of the response (e.g., text/html).

---

## **Step 3: Using Custom User-Agent Strings**
1. Send a request with a custom User-Agent string:
   ```bash
   curl -A "MyCustomUserAgent" http://example.com
   ```
   - **`-A`**: Sets the User-Agent header.
2. Check how the server responds to different User-Agent strings.

   **Insight**: Some servers return different content based on User-Agent.

---

## **Step 4: Sending POST Requests**
1. Send a POST request with form data:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -d "username=admin&password=1234" http://example.com/login
   ```
   - **`-X POST`**: Specifies the HTTP method.
   - **`-d`**: Sends data in the request body.

2. Observe the response to check if login was successful.

   **Tip**: Combine `-v` for verbose output to analyze the request/response details.

---

## **Step 5: Handling Cookies**
1. Save cookies to a file:
   ```bash
   curl -c cookies.txt http://example.com
   ```
   - **`-c`**: Saves cookies from the server to the specified file.

2. Send a request with saved cookies:
   ```bash
   curl -b cookies.txt http://example.com/dashboard
   ```
   - **`-b`**: Reads cookies from a file.

   **Insight**: Cookies are often used for session management and can reveal security weaknesses if not handled properly.

---

## **Step 6: Downloading Files**
1. Download a file from a URL:
   ```bash
   curl -O http://example.com/file.txt
   ```
   - **`-O`**: Saves the file with its original name.

2. Save the file with a custom name:
   ```bash
   curl -o custom_name.txt http://example.com/file.txt
   ```
   - **`-o`**: Saves the file with a specified name.

---

## **Step 7: Advanced Options**
1. **Verbose Output**:
   - View detailed request/response information:
     ```bash
     curl -v http://example.com
     ```

2. **Follow Redirects**:
   - Automatically follow HTTP redirects:
     ```bash
     curl -L http://example.com
     ```
     - **`-L`**: Follows `Location` headers for redirects.

3. **Authentication**:
   - Send a request with basic authentication:
     ```bash
     curl -u username:password http://example.com
     ```
     - **`-u`**: Provides credentials for HTTP Basic Auth.

4. **Testing APIs**:
   - Send JSON data in a request:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"value"}' http://example.com/api
     ```
     - **`-H`**: Sets custom headers.

---

## **Step 8: Mitigation Techniques**
1. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Prevent abuse by implementing rate limits on servers.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all inputs received from HTTP requests to prevent injection attacks.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Use strong authentication mechanisms like OAuth or API keys.

4. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Regularly review logs for suspicious activity, such as repeated requests from the same IP.

---

## **Additional Tips and Insights**
1. **Ethical Use**:
   - Use cURL only for testing your own systems or systems where you have explicit permission.

2. **Combining Tools**:
   - Integrate cURL with tools like Burp Suite for enhanced testing and debugging.

3. **Scripting**:
   - Automate repetitive tasks with shell scripts using cURL commands.

4. **Proxy Support**:
   - Use a proxy for testing or anonymization:
     ```bash
     curl -x http://proxy:port http://example.com
     ```

## **Key Takeaways**
1. cURL is a versatile tool for sending HTTP requests, testing APIs, and performing reconnaissance.
2. Understanding cURL commands helps analyze how web servers handle requests and responses.
3. Combine cURL with other security tools and techniques for comprehensive testing and automation.
