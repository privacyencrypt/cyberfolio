# Credential Harvesting Using Site Cloning

## **Objective**
Learn how to clone a website and capture user credentials using a tool like **SEToolkit**. This demonstrates the dangers of phishing and reinforces the importance of cybersecurity awareness.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Kali Linux**: This lab assumes you're using Kali Linux, a penetration testing operating system.
   - **Tip**: If you don’t have Kali Linux installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/) or set it up in a virtual machine using software like VirtualBox or VMware.
   - **Insight**: Kali Linux comes pre-installed with tools like SEToolkit, making it an ideal choice for beginners.

2. **Basic Network Knowledge**:
   - You should understand terms like **IP address**, **DNS**, and **HTTP/HTTPS**.
   - **Tip**: If you’re unsure, review the basics of how websites work and how they are hosted on servers.

---

## **Step 1: Launching Kali Linux**
1. Start your Kali Linux environment. If using a virtual machine, ensure it has internet access.
   - **Tip**: If you encounter network issues, check your VM’s network adapter settings. Set it to **NAT** for internet access.

2. Open a terminal by clicking the terminal icon or pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

---

## **Step 2: Updating the System**
Before using any tool, ensure your system and tools are up-to-date.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
   - **Tip**: Updating ensures you have the latest features and bug fixes. Older versions of tools might not work as expected.

---

## **Step 3: Launching SEToolkit**
1. In the terminal, type:
   ```bash
   sudo setoolkit
   ```
   - Enter your password if prompted.

2. You’ll see a menu. SEToolkit is highly menu-driven, so navigate carefully.

   - **Insight**: SEToolkit stands for "Social Engineering Toolkit" and is used to simulate social engineering attacks like phishing.

---

## **Step 4: Selecting the Attack Type**
1. From the main menu, choose:
   ```
   1) Social-Engineering Attacks
   ```
   - Press `1` and hit `Enter`.

2. In the next menu, choose:
   ```
   2) Website Attack Vectors
   ```
   - Press `2` and hit `Enter`.

---

## **Step 5: Selecting the Attack Method**
1. Choose the **Credential Harvester Attack Method**:
   ```
   3) Credential Harvester Attack Method
   ```
   - Press `3` and hit `Enter`.

   - **Insight**: This method captures user credentials (like usernames and passwords) when they interact with the cloned site.

---

## **Step 6: Selecting the Site Cloning Option**
1. From the menu, choose:
   ```
   2) Site Cloner
   ```
   - Press `2` and hit `Enter`.

---

## **Step 7: Setting Up the Server**
1. SEToolkit will ask for your **IP address**. Find it using the command:
   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```
   - Look for your **eth0** or **wlan0** interface and note the `inet` value (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
   - Enter this IP when prompted.

   - **Tip**: The IP address allows the cloned site to host locally. If testing on another device, ensure it can connect to this IP.

2. Enter the URL of the website you want to clone (e.g., `http://example.com`).
   - **Tip**: For better results, choose a non-HTTPS site. Many HTTPS sites may not clone perfectly due to SSL restrictions.
   - **Insight**: HTTPS (secure websites) make phishing harder but not impossible. Learning this helps you understand how attackers adapt.

---

## **Step 8: Running the Cloned Site**
1. Once SEToolkit sets up the cloned site, it starts a local server.
   - The terminal will show that the server is running and waiting for connections.

2. Test the cloned site by opening a browser on the same network and visiting your IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100`).
   - **Tip**: Use a private/incognito window to avoid caching issues.

   - **Insight**: Observe how identical the cloned site looks. This is why phishing emails are effective—they rely on convincing replicas of real sites.

---

## **Step 9: Capturing Credentials**
1. When someone interacts with the cloned site (e.g., enters a username and password), the credentials are captured and displayed in the terminal.

   - **Insight**: You’ll see entries like:
     ```
     POST DATA:
     username=admin&password=1234
     ```
     - This demonstrates how attackers steal sensitive information.

---

## **Step 10: Cleaning Up**
1. Stop the SEToolkit server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
2. Clear logs or data collected during the test:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /var/www/html/*
   ```

   - **Tip**: Always clean up to avoid leaving unnecessary files on your system.

---

## **Additional Tips and Insights**
1. **Test in a Controlled Environment**:
   - Only use this on networks and systems you own or have permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal.
   - **Insight**: Ethical hackers must abide by strict legal and ethical guidelines.

2. **Phishing Awareness**:
   - Observe the cloned site critically. What gives it away as fake? Use these insights to educate others on spotting phishing attempts.
   - **Tip**: Look for mismatched URLs, lack of HTTPS, and poor grammar in phishing emails.

3. **Understand the Risks**:
   - This exercise highlights how attackers exploit trust in well-known websites. Share your learnings to promote better cybersecurity practices.

4. **Keep Learning**:
   - Experiment with different websites, but always document your findings.
   - **Insight**: This practice will enhance your technical skills and strengthen your understanding of attack vectors.

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **Credential harvesting** involves tricking users into providing sensitive information on a cloned site.
2. Tools like SEToolkit make it easy to replicate this attack, highlighting the need for robust awareness and defenses.
3. Ethical hacking involves not only understanding how attacks work but also helping others recognize and prevent them.
