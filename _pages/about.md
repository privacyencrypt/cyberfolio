Hello there!
Welcome to my corner of the digital world. My name is Ty, and I am an educator-turned-cybersecurity enthusiast with a mission to make the digital space safer for everyone. With a Master’s degree in Teaching and a deep passion for learning, I’ve dedicated my career to helping others grow—and now, I’m channeling that same dedication into cybersecurity as an aspiring SOC Analyst.

> Security is not a product, but a process. It’s about people, education, and continuous improvement.

Coming from a strong background in education, I’ve always believed that teaching is one of the most powerful tools to inspire and empower others. Whether I’m breaking down a complex concept in the classroom or troubleshooting a security vulnerability in a digital environment, I find joy in exploring, explaining, and simplifying the intricate. My transition into cybersecurity stems from my belief that knowledge should not only empower but also protect.

In today’s ever-evolving digital landscape, cybersecurity is a cornerstone of safety. My goal is to bridge my teaching expertise with my cybersecurity skills to educate others about the importance of staying secure online. As I grow into the role of a SOC Analyst, I’m committed to applying my problem-solving skills and attention to detail to protect systems, monitor threats, and mitigate risks.

Curiosity has always been my compass. As a perpetual learner, I am excited to dive deep into new technologies, methodologies, and frameworks within the cybersecurity world. Whether it’s mastering Linux, Python, or learning through hands-on labs, I thrive in environments that challenge me to grow. This journey is not just about advancing my career—it’s about embracing the joy of learning and sharing that joy with others.

Teaching is my foundation, and I carry that spirit with me in cybersecurity. I aim to mentor, collaborate, and contribute to building a safer online world. Whether it’s helping a student grasp a new concept, documenting cybersecurity labs to guide other learners, or joining discussions in the community, I believe in giving back to the field that has opened so many doors for me.

For me, cybersecurity is not just a career—it’s an opportunity to combine my skills in teaching, analysis, and problem-solving to make a meaningful impact. Every challenge is an opportunity to grow, every success inspires me to push further, and every experience strengthens my commitment to keeping digital spaces safe for all.
